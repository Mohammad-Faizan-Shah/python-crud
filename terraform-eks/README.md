# Terraform EKS & RDS Deployment Guide

This repository contains Terraform configuration to deploy an Amazon EKS cluster with supporting infrastructure for a Python CRUD application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **AWS CLI** - For authentication with AWS  
   [Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

2. **Terraform** - For infrastructure provisioning  
   [Installation Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

## Configuration

### AWS Authentication

Configure your AWS credentials using:

```sh
aws configure
```

Youâ€™ll need to provide:

	â€¢	AWS Access Key ID
	â€¢	AWS Secret Access Key
	â€¢	Default AWS Region
	â€¢	Default Output Format (optional)

# Required Variables

Create a terraform.tfvars file in the root directory with the following variables:

## Required
db_password = "YourStrongPasswordHere"

## Optional - override defaults if needed

    kubernetes_version = 1.32
    vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
    aws_region = "us-east-1"
    db_username = "crud_user"
    db_name = "crud_db"

âš  Important: Never commit your terraform.tfvars file to version control as it contains sensitive information.

# Deployment Steps

1. ### Initialize Terraform
  Run the following command to initialize Terraform:
  ```sh
terraform init
```

2. ### Review the Terraform Plan

To see what resources will be created, run:

    terraform plan

3. ### Apply the Terraform Configuration

To deploy the infrastructure, run:

    terraform apply

Type yes when prompted to confirm the deployment.

After applying, note the MySQL endpoint URL from the outputs - you'll need this to configure the application:


4. ### Grant IAM access entries to EKSCluster
	1.	Go to the AWS Console and navigate to EKS Clusters.
	2.	Select the EKS Cluster that you created.
	3.	Click Access â†’ IAM access entries.
	4.	Follow the form and add AmazonEKSClusterAdminPolicy.
	5.	Save the changes.

5. ### Configure kubectl to Connect to Your Cluster

After the deployment is complete, configure kubectl to connect to your new EKS cluster:

    aws eks update-kubeconfig --region $(terraform output -raw aws_region) --name $(terraform output -raw cluster_id)

ðŸ“Œ Notes
	â€¢	Ensure your AWS credentials have the necessary permissions to create and manage EKS resources.
	â€¢	Modify the variables in terraform.tfvars as needed to customize your deployment.
	â€¢	Always review Terraform plans before applying changes.
